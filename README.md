# ComputationalArt
## About
This is project is based on the computational art mini project from the Olin's Software Design class offered in Spring 2017.  
More info [here](https://sd17spring.github.io/assignments/mini-project-2-computational-art/).

It's provided interesting explorations into lambda functions and Python's logging functionality, two things I didn't have any experience with prior to working on this.
